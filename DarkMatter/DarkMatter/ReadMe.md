DarkMatter Dark noise machine.

Figured out how to get the sound in the simulator and working.
the button for start stop dont work yet. But thats not a big problem to fix. the main part was to get it working in theory so i can add more sounds.

the next step now is to first make the user infterface lok good.
and then code each of the pages DarkMatter should have.

Looks like this was a very doable project.
it just needs patience and tweaking the UI to be a real contender.
Also needs more sounds, but thats not a big problem for now, as it will be added later. I can just make some noise patterns and scapes on the synth at a later stage. I can even bring the synth to school and work on the diffrent soundscapes i want and make a day or week of it after i have made some improvments to the design and made a template in exalidraw to make sure it looks like i want it. maybe i need to start using figma, but in my head, for now i only need to make some rough drawings on what i thing the UI should look like

everything looks good.
have to do the settings, and then its more or less a done deal, and i can move to the next project
